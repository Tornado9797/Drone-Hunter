# Drone Hunter
A point-and-click shooter Game Maker game, developed by Trey Bohannon, Nick Oldham, and myself.

## Premise
This was my 9th grade computer science class final project, and also the last academic project for Game Maker.

## Usage
Move the pointer with the mouse and left click to shoot down drones. Ammo isn't infinite, so right click to reload.
